# Progress: SeireiTranslations EPUB Generator

## What Works

### Core Functionality
- ✅ Command-line interface with all required parameters
- ✅ URL list parsing from text file
- ✅ Content extraction from SeireiTranslations blog posts
- ✅ HTML cleaning and formatting with both custom processing and go-readability
- ✅ Image downloading and processing
- ✅ EPUB generation with proper metadata
- ✅ Chapter organization and structure
- ✅ Debug mode for troubleshooting

### Specific Features
- ✅ Custom chapter titles from URL list
- ✅ Custom cover image
- ✅ Consistent styling via embedded CSS
- ✅ Handling of "Part X" sections as subtitles
- ✅ Removal of navigation elements and advertisements
- ✅ Proper error handling and logging
- ✅ Multi-chapter support with correct sequencing
- ✅ Cache for downloaded files in debug mode
- ✅ Attribution chapter with support links for translators

## What's Left to Build

### Potential Enhancements
- ⬜ Support for additional blog sites beyond SeireiTranslations
- ⬜ Automated testing framework
- ⬜ Configuration file support (as alternative to command-line args)
- ⬜ Chapter merging/splitting options
- ⬜ Progress bar or improved progress indication
- ⬜ Option to customize CSS styling
- ⬜ Batch processing of multiple novels

### Possible Improvements
- ⬜ Parallel processing of URLs (with rate limiting)
- ⬜ Enhanced error recovery mechanisms
- ⬜ More robust image handling for edge cases
- ⬜ Support for additional EPUB metadata fields
- ⬜ Table of contents customization options

## Current Status
The project is in a functional state with all core requirements implemented. It successfully extracts content from SeireiTranslations blog posts and generates well-formatted EPUB files with proper chapter organization, images, and styling.

### Latest Developments
- Modular code structure implemented
- Advanced content extraction patterns developed
- Debug mode with detailed diagnostics added
- Special handling for formatted elements added

### Stability Assessment
- Core extraction functionality: **Medium-High stability**
  - Works well for standard blog posts
  - May require adjustments if blog structure changes
- HTML processing: **High stability**
  - Robust cleaning and formatting
  - Handles most HTML variations well
- EPUB generation: **High stability**
  - Produces valid EPUB files
  - Proper chapter organization and navigation

## Known Issues

### Content Extraction
- Some unusually formatted blog posts may not extract correctly
- Detection of chapter boundaries can be imperfect in some cases
- Very complex HTML structures might lose some formatting

### Performance
- Sequential URL processing can be slow for large novels
- Image processing adds significant time to EPUB generation
- Debug mode significantly increases disk usage

### User Experience
- Command-line interface lacks interactive features
- Limited feedback during processing (primarily logs)
- No built-in validation of URL list format

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Content Extraction Strategy
- **Initial Approach**: Simple extraction after h4 heading
- **Current Approach**: Multiple pattern strategy with fallbacks
- **Rationale**: Increased robustness to handle blog structure variations

### HTML Processing
- **Initial Approach**: Basic cleaning of inline styles
- **Previous Approach**: Comprehensive cleaning with special handling for specific elements
- **Current Approach**: Multi-stage cleaning with custom processing followed by go-readability standardization
- **Rationale**: Improved formatting consistency and simplified HTML structure for better e-reader display

### Code Organization
- **Initial Approach**: Single package with all functionality
- **Current Approach**: Modular structure with clear separation of concerns
- **Rationale**: Improved maintainability and potential for reuse

### Debug Capabilities
- **Initial Approach**: Simple logging
- **Current Approach**: Detailed logging, preservation of intermediate files, caching
- **Rationale**: Better troubleshooting for extraction issues
